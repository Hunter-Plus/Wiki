# Purpose
These wikis are about setting up Web3 development environment on new device. I usually develope on Linux OS while still enjoy some good features of Windows. After a lot of fun attempts, I decided to standardize my environment by build up this detailed wiki.
# Windows
VS Code, Remix, Git(for Wiki), MobaXterm, Chrome, WSL(optional)
# Linux
VS Code(Remote), Git, Solidity,
